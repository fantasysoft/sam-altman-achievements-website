            <div class="card">
                <p>Sam Altman was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. From an early age, he showed an interest in technology, receiving his first computer at the age of 8. This early exposure to computing sparked a passion that would shape his future career.</p>
                <p>Altman attended John Burroughs School in St. Louis before enrolling at Stanford University to study computer science. However, his entrepreneurial spirit led him to drop out of Stanford after just two years to pursue his business ambitions full-time.</p>
                <p>During his brief time at Stanford, Altman began developing the ideas that would eventually lead to his first major venture, Loopt, marking the beginning of his remarkable journey in the tech industry.</p>

                    <h3>Loopt</h3>
                    <p>In 2005, at just 19 years old, Sam Altman co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking mobile application. As CEO, he led the company through multiple funding rounds, raising over $30 million in venture capital.</p>
                    <p>Loopt was one of the first mobile apps to utilize location data for social networking, allowing users to share their locations with friends and discover nearby places and events. The company was an early pioneer in the mobile social space.</p>
                    <p>In 2012, Loopt was acquired by Green Dot Corporation, a financial technology company, for approximately $43.4 million, marking Altman's first significant exit in the tech industry.</p>

                    <p>In 2014, Altman succeeded Paul Graham as president of Y Combinator (YC), one of the world's most prestigious startup accelerators. Under his leadership, YC expanded significantly, increasing both the number of startups it funded and the scope of its operations.</p>
                    <p>During his tenure, YC helped launch numerous successful companies including Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, and Coinbase. Altman implemented several innovative programs, including YC Research, a non-profit research lab, and the YC Growth Program for later-stage startups.</p>
                    <p>Altman stepped down from his role at YC in 2019 to focus full-time on OpenAI, but his impact on the startup ecosystem through YC remains significant.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p>In 2015, Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI alongside Elon Musk and others as a non-profit AI research laboratory committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. In 2019, he became the CEO of OpenAI LP when the organization restructured to a "capped-profit" model to attract more capital while maintaining its mission.</p>
                <p>Under Altman's leadership, OpenAI secured a landmark $1 billion investment from Microsoft in 2019, followed by an additional reported $10 billion investment in 2023. These partnerships have provided OpenAI with the resources needed to develop increasingly sophisticated AI systems.</p>
                <p>Altman oversaw the development and release of groundbreaking AI models including GPT-3, GPT-4, DALL-E, and ChatGPT. The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a watershed moment for AI, gaining over a million users within its first week and sparking widespread public interest in generative AI.</p>
                <p>In November 2023, Altman was briefly ousted as CEO by OpenAI's board, citing communication issues. However, following significant backlash from employees and investors, he was reinstated just five days later, demonstrating his crucial importance to the organization.</p>

                <p>In November 2023, Altman was unexpectedly fired as CEO of OpenAI by the board, which cited concerns about his communications with the board. This decision triggered a massive backlash, with nearly all OpenAI employees threatening to resign. After five days of intense negotiations, Altman was reinstated as CEO with a restructured board.</p>

                <h3>Scarlett Johansson Voice Controversy</h3>
                <p>In 2024, OpenAI faced criticism when it released an AI assistant voice called "Sky" that sounded remarkably similar to actress Scarlett Johansson's voice. Johansson stated that she had declined an offer to be the voice of the assistant, and OpenAI subsequently removed the voice. Altman publicly apologized for the situation.</p>
